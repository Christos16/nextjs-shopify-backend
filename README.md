## Running the Application

This application can be run using Docker Compose, set up locally on your machine, or connected to an existing MongoDB Atlas instance for accessing pre-populated data.

### Using Docker Compose

To run the application with Docker Compose, ensure Docker is installed and follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Execute `docker-compose up` in your terminal to start the backend server and database.
4. Access the application at `http://localhost:9000`.

### Running Locally

For a local setup without Docker, please follow these instructions:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Install dependencies with `yarn install`.
4. Start the backend server using `yarn start`.
5. The application will be available at `http://localhost:9000`.

### Connecting to MongoDB Atlas

If you face any issues with the database setup or prefer to work with a dataset that has already been populated, you can connect to a MongoDB Atlas instance I manage. This instance contains populated data, facilitating a smoother start with the application.

**To request access to this MongoDB Atlas database, please reach out to me directly or inform Harel, who will pass on the message.** This will allow you to bypass local database setup and directly access a comprehensive dataset for development purposes.
